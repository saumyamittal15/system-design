# Payments App System Design

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to designing a **Payments App** capable of handling **millions of transactions daily**. The system is built with scalability, resiliency, fault tolerance, and security at its core, ensuring seamless financial operations for users and merchants.

---

## 📖 **Overview**

The Payments App architecture is designed to:
- Process millions of transactions per day.
- Ensure high availability (99.99% uptime) through fault-tolerant mechanisms.
- Provide low-latency transaction processing (<2 seconds under normal conditions).
- Secure sensitive data using encryption and PCI-DSS compliance.
- Prevent duplicate payments with idempotency mechanisms.
- Handle peak traffic dynamically using auto-scaling.

---

## 🛠️ **Features**

### Functional Requirements:
1. **Payment Initiation**: Accept payment requests via API and validate transaction details.
2. **Transaction Management**: Track transaction states (`initiated`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`) and handle retries for transient failures.
3. **Fraud Detection**: Analyze transactions in real-time to detect anomalies.
4. **Wallet Management**: Update merchant wallets after successful payments.
5. **Ledger Management**: Maintain a double-entry ledger for reconciliation and auditing.
6. **Notifications**: Notify users and merchants about transaction statuses.
7. **Refund Processing**: Handle refund requests efficiently.
8. **Reconciliation**: Periodically reconcile records with Payment Service Providers (PSPs).

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- Horizontal scalability to support millions of transactions daily.
- Fault tolerance with retries, dead-letter queues (DLQs), and failover mechanisms.
- Data encryption at rest and in transit for security compliance.
- Dynamic scaling during traffic surges to handle peak loads.

## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

### High-Level Design (HLD)

| Component                  | Purpose                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| API Gateway                | Routes client requests; handles authentication and rate limiting.                         |
| Payment Service            | Orchestrates payment processing; interacts with PSPs; ensures idempotency and retries.   |
| Transaction Management     | Tracks transaction states; publishes state changes to Kafka topics.                       |
| Wallet Service             | Updates merchant wallet balances post-payment success.                                    |
| Ledger Service             | Maintains a double-entry ledger for all financial transactions for reconciliation/auditing purposes. |
| Fraud Detection Service    | Analyzes transactions in real-time to detect fraud patterns or anomalies.                 |
| Notification Service       | Sends asynchronous notifications about transaction statuses (success/failure).            |
| Refund Service             | Handles refund requests and updates transaction states accordingly.                       |

## 📂 **Database Schema**

### Payment Table:
```
CREATE TABLE Payments (
    payment_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    merchant_id UUID NOT NULL,
    amount VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- Stored as string to avoid floating-point precision issues
    currency VARCHAR(3),
    status VARCHAR(20), -- e.g., initiated, processing, completed, failed
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    idempotency_key UUID UNIQUE
);
```

### Ledger Table:
```
CREATE TABLE Ledger (
    ledger_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    transaction_id UUID NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(20), -- e.g., debit, credit
    amount VARCHAR(20),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    metadata JSONB
);
```

## 🚀 **Scalability & Resiliency Strategies**

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Deploy microservices across multiple nodes using Kubernetes or similar orchestration tools.
2. **Partitioning & Sharding**:
   - Partition Kafka topics by merchant ID or region to distribute load evenly across consumers.
   - Shard databases by user ID or region to reduce contention on write operations.
3. **Caching Mechanisms**:
   - Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data such as recent transaction statuses or merchant profiles.

### Fault Tolerance:
- Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient failures.
- Use Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs) for unprocessable events requiring manual intervention or reprocessing.
- Ensure idempotency with unique keys stored in Redis or databases.

## 🔒 **Security Measures**

1. Encrypt data at rest using AES-256 encryption and in transit using TLS/HTTPS protocols.
2. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data and APIs.
3. Regularly scan codebases for vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk or OWASP Dependency-Check.
4. Schedule periodic backups of critical databases to cloud storage systems like AWS S3 with versioning enabled.

## 📜 **APIs**

### Key Endpoints:
1. `POST /payments`: Initiate a payment request.
2. `GET /payments/{id}`: Retrieve the status of a payment using its unique identifier.
3. `POST /refunds`: Request a refund for a transaction.
4. `POST /webhook`: Receive asynchronous updates from PSPs (e.g., payment success/failure).
5. `GET /ledger`: Retrieve transaction history for reconciliation.

#### Example Request:
```
POST /payments
{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "merchant_id": "67890",
  "amount": "1000",
  "currency": "USD",
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "card",
    "details": {
      "card_number": "4111111111111111",
      "expiry_date": "12/25",
      "cvv": "123"
    }
  },
  "idempotency_key": "unique-key-uuid"
}
```

#### Example Response:
```
{
  "status": "processing",
  "payment_id": "txn-78901"
}
```
