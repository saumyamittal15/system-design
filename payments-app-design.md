# Payments System: Scalable Design for Millions of Transactions

This repository contains the architecture, design principles, and implementation strategies for building a **payments system** capable of handling **millions of transactions per day**. The system is designed to ensure **scalability**, **resiliency**, **fault tolerance**, and **data security** while maintaining low latency and high availability.

## üöÄ **Overview**

The payments system is designed to:
1. Seamlessly process millions of transactions daily.
2. Ensure high uptime (99.99%) with fault-tolerant mechanisms.
3. Provide robust data security compliant with PCI-DSS standards.
4. Handle peak loads dynamically through horizontal scaling.

### Key Features:
- **Payment Processing**: Integration with Payment Service Providers (PSPs) like Stripe and PayPal.
- **Fraud Detection**: Real-time analysis to prevent fraudulent activities.
- **Wallet & Ledger Management**: Double-entry ledger for accurate financial tracking.
- **Notifications & Refunds**: User-friendly updates and efficient refund handling.

---

## **Functional Requirements (FRs)**

1. **Payment Initiation**:
   - Accept payment requests from users via API.
   - Validate payment details and initiate transactions with PSPs.
2. **Transaction Management**:
   - Track transaction states (`initiated`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`).
   - Handle retries for transient failures.
3. **Fraud Detection**:
   - Analyze transactions for potential fraud in real-time.
4. **Wallet Management**:
   - Update merchant wallets after successful payments.
5. **Ledger Management**:
   - Maintain a double-entry ledger for all transactions.
6. **Notifications**:
   - Notify users and merchants about transaction statuses.
7. **Refund Processing**:
   - Handle refund requests and update transaction states accordingly.
8. **Reconciliation**:
   - Periodically reconcile transaction records with PSPs to ensure consistency.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

1. **Scalability**: Handle millions of transactions per day with horizontal scaling.
2. **Resiliency & Fault Tolerance**: Ensure high availability (99.99% uptime) with retries, dead-letter queues (DLQs), and failover mechanisms.
3. **Low Latency**: Process payments within 2 seconds under normal conditions.
4. **Data Security**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit; comply with PCI-DSS standards.
5. **Idempotency**: Prevent duplicate payments caused by retries or network errors.
6. **Data Integrity Monitoring**: Use cryptographic checksums to ensure data consistency across systems.

## üåü **APIs**

### Key APIs:
1. `POST /payments`: Initiate a payment request.
2. `GET /payments/{id}`: Retrieve the status of a payment using its unique identifier.
3. `POST /refunds`: Request a refund for a transaction.
4. `POST /webhook`: Receive asynchronous updates from PSPs (e.g., payment success/failure).
5. `GET /ledger`: Retrieve transaction history for reconciliation.

### Example API Design:
#### `POST /payments`
```
{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "merchant_id": "67890",
  "amount": "1000",
  "currency": "USD",
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "card",
    "details": {
      "card_number": "4111111111111111",
      "expiry_date": "12/25",
      "cvv": "123"
    }
  },
  "idempotency_key": "unique-key-uuid"
}
```

Response:
```
{
  "status": "processing",
  "payment_id": "txn-78901"
}
```

## üìÇ **Entities and Database Design**

### Core Entities

#### Payments Table
```
CREATE TABLE Payments (
    payment_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    merchant_id UUID NOT NULL,
    amount VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    currency VARCHAR(3),
    status VARCHAR(20), -- e.g., initiated, processing, completed, failed
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    idempotency_key UUID UNIQUE
);
```

#### Ledger Table
```
CREATE TABLE Ledger (
    ledger_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    transaction_id UUID NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(20), -- e.g., debit, credit
    amount VARCHAR(20),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    metadata JSONB
);
```

### Components:

| Component                  | Purpose                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| API Gateway                | Routes client requests to appropriate services; handles authentication and rate limiting. |
| Payment Service            | Orchestrates payment processing; interacts with PSPs; ensures idempotency and retries.   |
| Transaction Management     | Tracks transaction states; handles retries; publishes state changes to Kafka topics.      |
| Wallet Service             | Updates merchant wallet balances post-payment success.                                    |
| Ledger Service             | Maintains a double-entry ledger for reconciliation and auditing purposes.                 |
| Fraud Detection Service    | Analyzes transactions in real-time to detect fraud patterns or anomalies.                 |
| Notification Service       | Sends asynchronous notifications about transaction statuses (success/failure).            |
| Refund Service             | Handles refund requests and updates transaction states accordingly.                       |

## üìà **Deep Dives**

### Resiliency & Fault Tolerance:
1. Use Kafka as the messaging backbone with Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs) for failed events.
2. Implement retries with exponential backoff to handle transient failures.
3. Use idempotency keys to prevent duplicate processing of requests.

### Scalability Strategies:
1. Horizontal scaling using Kubernetes or container orchestration platforms.
2. Partitioning Kafka topics by merchant ID or region to distribute load evenly.
